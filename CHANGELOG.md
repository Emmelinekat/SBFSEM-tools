# Changelog

### 1Jan2017
- Closed curves are now rendered with Catmull-Rom splines (rather than just the control points).
- Improved the default lighting on render figures.

### 3Jan2017
- RenderApp
- Synapses no longer automatically download (huge speed improvement). To import synapses, the 3rd argument of Neuron should be set to true:
```
% Import with synapses
c6800 = Neuron(6800, 'i', true);

% No synapses imported
c6800 = Neuron(6800, 'i');
% Add synapses
c6800.getSynapses();
'''
- A faster way to interact with renders
```
% Before: created a separate render object
c121 = Neuron(121, 't');
r121 = sbfsem.render.Cylinder(c121);
% Now access through the cell
c121.build(); % BUILD creates the model
c121.render(); % RENDER shows the model
% Cylinder is the default, for closed curve:
c2542 = Neuron(2542, 'i');
c2542.build('closed curve');
'''
- I moved Neuron out of the sbfsem folder so no more sbfsem.Neuron or importing sbfsem. Just use Neuron.
